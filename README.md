# dashboard
This dashboard is made for our stakeholder Handpicked Labs. They wanted an interactive component taht would show what Handpicked does. We made a Wonder mirror for it that can put a filter in the mirror where the user is standing. To manage and create filters, we made a CMS.

## Project setup
For the project set up you first have to install vue if you don't have the vue cli globaly installed. You can make this happen with;
```
npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global
``` 
or
``` 
yarn global add @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global
``` 

After you instaled vue-cli globally, you can install the dependencies from the package.json with;
```
npm install
```


### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

After you finished installing the dependencies, you can deploy the local host with;

```
npm run serve
```
